Project Goal: Start learning working with complex file structure and uploading files to GitHub. The main content is to visualize the shot data of players
from Golden State Warriors through producing "shot charts". We also need to produce a report document of the project with some narrative.

File structure:the structure of the files in the project are as follows:
workout1/
  README.md
  data/
    andre-iguodala.csv
	draymond-green.csv
	kevin-durant.csv
	klay-thompson.csv
	stephen-curry.csv
	shots-data.csv
	data-dictionary.csv
  code/ # R script files
    make-shots-data-script.R
	make-shot-charts-script.R
  output/ # R outputs
    shots-data-summary.txt
	... # other summary.txt files
  images/ # plot images
    nba-count.jpg
	... # other image files
  report/
    workout1-Yuxuan-Wei.Rmd
