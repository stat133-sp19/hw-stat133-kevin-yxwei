#Cooking Recipe
###Quick Potato Pierogi 
<div align=left>
* Ingredients     
     + baking potatoes    
     + unsalted butter
     + onions/green onions
     + salt 
     + black pepper
     + gyoza (pot sticker) wrappers
     + cream
     
* Special kitchen tools    
     + Using a round cookie or biscuit cutter the width of the smaller side of the dumpling wrapper

* Steps     
     1.Sour cream, melted butter or vinegar to serve    
     2.Cook the potatoes in a large pot of salted boiling water until just tender.
     3.Melt the butter in a large heavy frying pan and cook the onions until they soften then lightly brown, darkly browned in spots.
     4.Mash the potatoes in a bowl then mix in the onions and their cooking butter. Season generously with salt and pepper.  
     5.Using a round cookie or biscuit cutter the width of the smaller side of the dumpling wrapper, cut 10 to 12 wrappers at a time into circles, discarding the extra. Working on at a time, brush the edge of the round wrapper with water and place a spoonful of filling in the center. Fold dumpling in half, pressing the edges together to thoroughly seal. 
     6.Place each dumpling on a parchment or waxed paper lined baking sheet and repeat until all filling has been used. 
     7.Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and add the dumplings one at a time, until the surface of the pan is covered with dumplings. 
     8.Transfer to bowls and serve sprinkled with green onions, parsley or chives, drizzled with a little melted butter or vinegar or topped with a deb of sour cream.

**No special season**

*Variations of the recipe:*  
*Russian, Latvian, and Ukrainian varieties, with their more bread-like quality, are more likely to contain meat. Polish, Slovak, and Czech versions tend toward more of a pasta dough and are more likely to contain potatoes or cabbage. Lithuanian pierogi are like a bridge between the two, with meat fillings but a noodle-like casing. *

#Euclidean Distance
<div align=left>
<font size=6>
**Definition**
</font>
<font size=4>
[edit]  
The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\overline{pq}$)  
In [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system), if **p** = (p1, p2,..., pn) and **q** = (q1, q2,..., qn) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then  
the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the [Pythagorean formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem):  

\begin{equation}
d(p,q) = d(q,p) = \sqrt{(q_{1}-p_{1})^2+(q_{2}-p_{2})^2+...+(q_{n}-p_{n})^2)}\\     
                = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}(q_{i}-p_{i})^2}.
\end{equation}  

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector). So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of  
the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The [Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm), or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector  
measures the length of the vector:  

\begin{equation}
||p|| = \sqrt{p_{1}^2+p_{2}^2+...+p_{n}^2} =  \sqrt{p\times p},
\end{equation}  

where the last expression involves the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).
